# Advanced Research Agent

Advanced Research Agent is a Python-based autonomous research system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Firecrawl to perform intelligent web research.

The project demonstrates the evolution from a simple interactive agent into a structured, workflow-driven research agent capable of crawling websites, extracting information, and returning structured research results.
